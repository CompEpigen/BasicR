# Reproducible programming

## General rules

1. the scripts should be written in a way, that either you, or someone else will be able to run it anytime.

2. Clean structure, according to the best programming practices

* Variable names according the convention (use _. not " " or -, don't use keywords)
* `<-` instead of `=`
* spaces before and after
* Indentation
* curly brackets
* don't store unnecessary objects
* avoid repetition

- comment your codes in detail
- Use sessionInfo() to know your package versions
- Use as generalized code as possible - use names and regular expressions instead of indices. 
- if possible, define your paths at the beginning and use paste() or file.path() later. Or use relative paths
- try to do everything from R, because changes in e.g. excel are undocumented.


## Use version control

- git is an easy tool to do version control.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
    knitr::include_graphics("https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png", dpi = 100)
    ```



## Rmarkdown, R notebooks

* Rmarkdown document, with code chuncks
* Markdown language is easy to learn, see the cheatsheat
* many templates available - flexible themes
* Description, codes and figures at the same place. 
* Figures are saved separately as well - or use links
* Appearance of the code depends on the chunk options.

Show code and output

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Show only output

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Show code only, don't run

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

* Suppress warnings and messages, if needed.
* Use cheatsheets
* easy to add pictures, links, etc.
* easy to add nice tables

```{r, results='asis'}
library(dplyr)
data("mtcars")
knitr::kable(mtcars, format = "html")
print(xtable::xtable(mtcars), type = 'html')
 mtcars %>%
 	DT::datatable(filter = 'top', 
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE, keys = TRUE, pageLength = 5),  
          rownames = FALSE)
```

* easy to share with collaborators

## workflowr package
* does the above steps automatically
* keeps a nice folder structure
* easy to use git 


# Exercises:

- set up git with Rstudio
- set up your github account with workflowr
- create a new project using wflow_start()
- create a new markdown file in the analysis folder, my_first_project
- load luad file from extdata

- delete empty columns using a for cycle and if statements. 
- modify days since birth that it appears in years. google the exact number of days in a year. 
- Create tables for Diagnosis.Age, Sex, Race.Category and American.Joint.Committee.on.Cancer.Tumor.Stage.Code
- do chi-sq test for American.Joint.Committee.on.Cancer.Tumor.Stage.Code and Sex Plot the data (e.g. barplot, counts by gender)
- do linear regression for the Mutation.Count and stage, gender and age. show the results in table. Plot the data.
