## The tasks based on exercises from Reka:

1. Create a workflowr project
2. Set it up so it works with github. 
3. Create a Markdown file in the analyis folder and solve the exercises from Rajbir. 
4. Add the following code to the end of the Rmd file and set `eval=TRUE` (see the code in the assignment.Rmd file):

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/code_hero.jpg?raw=true", dpi = 100)
```


4. Publish and push the file to github. 
5. Set up the github pages with the repository. 
6. As the result of the assignment, send us the link of your webpage.

7. Use the hfi dataset from the `openintro` package
8. Fit a new model that uses  `pf_expression_control` to predict `hf_score`, or the total human freedom score.
9. Again add region to the model from Q4. Compare the slope and $R^2$ with the model from Q4.

10. Finally fit a model with `ef_money` and `pf_expression_control` as exposures and `hf_score` as outcome.  Compare the slope and $R^2$ from the models from Q1. Could `ef_money` be a confounder? 

11. Use a linear regression model (and scatter plot) with  `ef_money` as exposure and `pf_expression_control` as outcome, to study whether `ef_money` has an association with `pf_expression_control` as well. This might validate our finding that `ef_money` is a confounder between  `pf_expression_control` as exposure and 
`hf_score` as outcome from Q6.
