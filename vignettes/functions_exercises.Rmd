1. Write a function that divides two numbers. If the divider is zero, it shouldn't try the division, but give a message about it. 

```{r}


```


2. Write a function that changes all vowels of a string to e-s.

```{r}

```


3. Add a checking part, that checks if the input is indeed one character and it has vowels in it. If not, it should give a message. 

```{r}

```

4.  Write a function that calculates the variance of a vector.

$$Var(x)=\frac 1{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i}-\overline{x})^2$$
where 
$$\overline{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}n$$
```{r}


```


5. Add code to check if the input data is in the correct format. 

```{r}

```

6. Add a warning, if the class of the input vector is not numeric, and try to coerce as one.

```{r}


```
